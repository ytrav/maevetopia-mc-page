            <h3>What is Maevetopia?</h3>
            <p>Maevetopian Settlement is a unique Minecraft server made by Maeve personally, as is this website! It's
                made for my wonderful community of Citizens of Maevetopia, the Discord server unlike the others.</p>
            <p>But what makes Maevetopia so special?</p>
            <p>This server is the result of weeks of tireless work by me, programmer and maintainer, and my friends
                helping me build the wonderful and lively neighbourhood that is Central Maevetopia.</p>

                    target="_blank">@ytrav_v</a></span>
            <p>Maevetopia has an engaging and realistic economy system you won't find on any other server - it's akin to
                one you would see in the real world, and I have ensured it doesn't disrupt vanilla gameplay for those
                looking for a classic experience</p>
            <p>Players can trade currency, buy and sell resources when needed, and even have their own stores sanctioned
                by the Central Government, like caf√©s, restaurants, bookstores and more!</p>
